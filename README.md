# custom_payment
In This module, we are creating a custom payment method. Custom pay method name can be configured and it can be accessible to specific customer groups based on the configurations. To disable or to change the configurations of the module login to your Magento admin. On the Admin sidebar, go to Store > Configuration > SALES > Payment Methods > Custom Payment Method. Also In this module, we have a custom product select attribute called "Net" and it has four different values NULL, Net15, Net30, Net60. If customers add products to the cart and go to checkout, according to custom product attribute value, the custom payment method will get displayed and append with the product custom attribute. If multiple products are in the cart then the Payment method will be shown as the highest value like Net60. Thank you for using the module. Looking forward to your feedback, Code improvement and Module Enhancement is Appreciated. For any Magento 2 projects or For Freelancing work drop a mail to "mohithdeveloper@gmail.com".
